## DOM Manipulation in JavaScript

This repository contains a single file named `dominjs.html` that demonstrates the basics of DOM manipulation using JavaScript. This README provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to use and understand the code.

### Repository Contents

- `dominjs.html`: This HTML file serves as the entry point for the application. It contains a basic structure and includes JavaScript code for DOM manipulation.

### What is DOM Manipulation?

DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation refers to the process of modifying the structure, content, or presentation of a web page using JavaScript. It allows you to dynamically update and interact with the elements on a web page.

### DOM Manipulation Examples

The `dominjs.html` file provides examples of common DOM manipulation tasks using JavaScript. Some of the examples include:

#### 1. Accessing DOM Elements

```javascript
// Accessing an element by ID
let elementById = document.getElementById("elementId");

// Accessing elements by class name
let elementsByClass = document.getElementsByClassName("className");

// Accessing elements by tag name
let elementsByTag = document.getElementsByTagName("tagName");
```

These examples demonstrate different ways to access DOM elements based on their ID, class name, or tag name.

#### 2. Modifying Element Content

```javascript
// Changing text content of an element
elementById.textContent = "New text content";

// Modifying HTML content of an element
elementById.innerHTML = "<h1>New HTML content</h1>";
```

These examples show how to change the text or HTML content of a specific element.

#### 3. Adding and Removing Elements

```javascript
// Creating a new element
let newElement = document.createElement("div");

// Appending the new element to an existing element
elementById.appendChild(newElement);

// Removing an element
elementById.remove();
```

These examples demonstrate how to create new elements, add them to the DOM, and remove existing elements.

### Running the Code

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `dominjs.html` file in a web browser.

3. Open the browser's developer console to view any output or errors generated by the JavaScript code.

4. Explore the `dominjs.html` file to understand the implementation of different DOM manipulation examples.

### Conclusion

This repository provides a basic understanding of DOM manipulation using JavaScript. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different DOM manipulation techniques to enhance your understanding.
